## My First Site as bootcamper in 2016 - Vanilla JS dev, new site coming soon

This is a vanilla JS site created to an exact UNH bootcamp specification

The purpose of this site was to learn and to understand how a static site made with
JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5 could be mobile responsive without using any libraries or frameworks.

It was a great experience to help see why frameworks such as React and Angular are so usefull.
However this was made to an exact specification requested by UNH and is not a representation of my skillset.
